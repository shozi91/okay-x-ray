                            Reason being is that it's better to be "overly cautious," and double check a result.

                            This would be opposed to the false negatives, which the model spits out. 

                            Of the 464 actual sick cases, 6.4% of our results came up as a false negative. However, we also set our confidence interval to 60%, wherein results
                            showing less than 60% would result in a message from us stating we are not confident enough to make a diagnosis.
